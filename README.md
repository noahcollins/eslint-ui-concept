eslint-ui-concept
=================

A concept web UI and docs site for ESLint project.

## Install

Clone this repo, then `npm install` and `bower install` to get up and running.

## Grunt Tasks

Run `grunt preview` for prototyping. Run `grunt production` task for image optimization, bundling, file revving, and so on.

## To-Do List

2014-01-06
- Host this project so people can preview it without building it locally
- Mock up the documentation browsing experience.
- Mock up the demo page experience.

2014-01-07
- Try a concept for rule configuration in the web UI. Probably not manageable do to the sheer number, but worth a shot.

## The Design

### The hexagons

Intended to evoke tooling and adjustment. The outer hex is rotated to convey a sense of motion. The inner hex is aligned to convey a sense of alignment. The metaphor: the inner and outer forms represent your code before and after ESLint, respectively.

### Colors

Why purple? It's not used much in the JS tooling space, so it helps keep things visually distinct. If anyone has strong reactions to that one way or another, there are plenty of other colors that would make sense.
